Ranks are commonly of interest because they allow readers to compare populations based on estimates of interest. For example, top  universities across the globe may be identified based on their institutional performance indicator, states may receive appropriate intervention according to their relative rank based on average travel times to work, and senatorial candidates who are likely to be granted a seat in the office can be reported by public opinion polling bodies prior to elections. Since ranks are computed from estimates rather than from their true, unknown values, it is implicit that their overall uncertainty—expressed through joint confidence intervals—should also be quantified. Individually, these intervals provide information on the possible range of each rank while collectively, they facilitate comparing all ranks simultaneously rather than reporting them in isolation. 

Several studies have addressed this concern through different techniques. Some approaches like those by  @klein, @jelle, @mogstadt23, @carling, and @johan, relied solely on the estimates and their standard errors, constructing joint confidence intervals either for the estimated quantities or directly for the ranks themselves. Others incorporate model-based uncertainty to account for dependencies inherent in the data structure. This includes the works of @spiegel, who utilized conditioning through multilevel models where the ranked quantities are treated as residual effects. @miller, on the other hand, developed a bootstrap algorithm that allows for the assumption of independence despite its potential violation.

Assuming independence when constructing joint confidence regions for estimators that are, in fact, correlated may lead to overly conservative and thus wider intervals, implying greater uncertainty—contrary to what is desired. It is therefore important to account for potential dependencies, as demonstrated by @spiegel. However, in their case, the estimators were treated as latent variables. In contrast, the present work focuses on estimators that are observable or directly measurable from the data.

A potential alternative approach, which to our knowledge has not yet been explored, is to allow for a certain degree of correlation and develop an algorithm capable of handling such dependencies while maintaining coverage close to the nominal level and producing relatively narrow joint confidence intervals. The proposed methodology uses only the observed estimators and their corresponding standard errors. Although it also employs a parametric bootstrap—commonly used to estimate overall rank uncertainties (e.g., @jelle, @mogstadt23, @carling, @johan)—our implementation differs from these existing approaches.

## Objective

This research builds upon @klein's methodology by extending the set of joint confidence intervals used to capture uncertainty in overall rankings. In particular, it intends to:

- Construct joint confidence intervals that utilize parametric bootstrap to obtain a narrow overall uncertainty for ranks.
- Establish joint confidence intervals for cases when ranks are assumed to be correlated.
- Evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches under different standard deviations, correlation structures, and dimensionalities.

## Significance

In order to obtain joint confidence sets for overall ranks, @klein requires estimating confidence intervals for the unknown parameters, with a joint coverage probability of at least $1-\alpha$. Their goal is to produce confidence intervals that collectively produce a small difference between the upper and the lower bound to yield tighter joint uncertainty for ranks. In the same paper, they considered the set of familiar $\hat{\theta} \pm z_{\alpha/2}+SE_k$ individual confidence intervals, assuming an independently distributed $\hat{\theta}_1, \hat{\theta}_2, \dots, \hat{\theta}_K$. This approach, while simple, disregards the idea that $\theta_k$s may be correlated. In some cases, assuming independence in the presence of dependence leads to conservative confidence intervals resulting in wider intervals which imply a higher uncertainty in overall ranks. 

For instance, in the case of ranking senatorial candidates in the Philippines, this assumption is limiting as it treats vote shares as statistically independent across contenders. Although senators are elected using Multiple Non-transferable Vote system (MNTV)---where candidates are voted for individually regardless of partisan membership and alliances (@pork)---@legara demonstrated that candidate with name-recall advantage, such as media celebrities, incumbents, and members of dynastic families, received majority of the votes in the 2010 senatorial elections. In that year, media personalities Bong Revilla and Jinggoy Estrada secured the top spots. A similar pattern was observed in 2019, when Cynthia Villar and Grace Poe, both with prominent surnames, garnered the most votes; and again in 2022, when media figures Robin Padilla and Ramon Tulfo ranked among the top three. They also added that in weak-party systems, candidates who belong to the same political alliance or ticket commonly co-occur in ballots and hence perform with similarity.

@klein also noted that although it is difficult to make generalizations about strong relationships between travel times to work, certain patterns are apparent. States with large unpopulated land areas and relatively few high-density population centers tend to report shorter travel times. In contrast, longer travel times are typically observed in highly urbanized states with large populations and high population densities. Geographic location also appears to play a role—for instance, many states with shorter travel times are located in the Mountain and Central regions, whereas majority of those with longer travel times are concentrated along the East Coast. These observations suggest the presence of potential spatial structures. Accounting for these patterns allows for a more realistic assessment of uncertainty in the estimated ranks for similar use cases.

## Scope and Limitations

This study presents alternative approaches for constructing joint confidence regions to quantify uncertainty in overall ranks, building upon the main results of @klein. Specifically, it demonstrates the application of the parametric bootstrap and the incorporation of correlation among the populations being ranked, with an emphasis on maintaining sufficient coverage and tightness in the resulting overall uncertainty. However, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the framework assumes that the data are generated from a multivariate normal distribution. Second, a set of correlation structures is examined to illustrate how different dependence assumptions may affect the resulting joint confidence sets; these structures are assumed rather than empirically estimated. Collectively, these limitations suggest that the findings should be regarded primarily as methodological illustrations.
