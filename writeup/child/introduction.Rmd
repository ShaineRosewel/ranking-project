## Objective

This research builds upon @klein's methodology by extending the set of joint confidence intervals used to capture uncertainty in overall rankings. In particular, it intends to:

- Construct joint confidence intervals that utilize parametric bootstrap to obtain a tighter overall uncertainty for ranks.
- Establish joint confidence intervals for cases when ranks are assumed to be correlated.
- Evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches under different standard deviations, correlation structures, and dimensionalities.

## Significance

In order to obtain joint confidence sets for overall ranks, the work of @klein requires estimating confidence intervals for the unknown parameters, with a joint coverage probability of at least $1-\alpha$. Their goal is to produce confidence intervals that collectively produce a small difference between the upper and the lower bound to yield tighter joint uncertainty. In the same paper, they considered the set of familiar $\hat{\theta} \pm z_{\alpha/2}+SE_k$ individual confidence intervals, assuming an independently distributed $\hat{\theta}_1, \hat{\theta}_2, \dots, \hat{\theta}_K$. This approach, while simple, disregards the idea that $\theta_k$s may be correlated. 

In the case of ranking senatorial candidates in the Philippines, this assumption is limiting as it treats vote shares as statistically independent across contenders. Although senators are elected using Multiple Non-transferable Vote system (MNTV) - where candidates are voted for individually regardless of partisan membership and alliances (@pork) - @legara demonstrated that candidate with name-recall advantage, such as media celebrities, incumbents, and members of dynastic families, received majority of the votes in the 2010 senatorial elections. In that year, media personalities Bong Revilla and Jinggoy Estrada secured the top spots. A similar pattern was observed in 2019, when Cynthia Villar and Grace Poe, both with prominent surnames, garnered the most votes; and again in 2022, when media figures Robin Padilla and Ramon Tulfo ranked among the top three. They also added that in weak-party systems, candidates who belong to the same political alliance or ticket commonly co-occur in ballots and hence perform with similarity, although not equally well. For example, in the 2025 election, several candidates from both the Marcos (Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilipinas) and Duterte (DuterTen) blocs secured seats, while others from the same groups did not. Accounting for these patterns allows for a more realistic assessment of uncertainty in the estimated ranks for similar use cases.

## Scope and Limitations

This study focuses on presenting alternative ways to construct joint confidence regions for quantifying uncertainty of overall ranks using the main result from @klein. It covers the application of parametric bootstrap and consideration of potential correlation among ranks while maintaining tightness in the resulting overall uncertainty. However, certain limitations must be acknowledged. First, a constraint is introduced by assuming that the data is generated from the normal distribution. Second, a number of correlation structures are examined to demonstrate how different dependence assumptions among candidates may influence the resulting joint confidence sets. However, identifying which structure best captures the actual voting behavior in the Philippine senatorial context is beyond the scope of this study. Overall, these limitations suggest that the findings should be viewed mainly as methodological examples.
