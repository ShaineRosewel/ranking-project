## Objective

This research builds upon @klein's methodology by extending the set of joint confidence intervals used to capture uncertainty in overall rankings. In particular, it intends to:

- Construct joint confidence intervals that utilize parametric bootstrap to obtain a tighter overall uncertainty for ranks.
- Establish joint confidence intervals for cases when ranks are assumed to be correlated.
- Evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches under different standard deviations, correlation structures, and dimensionalities.

## Significance

In order to obtain joint confidence sets for overall ranks, the work of @klein requires estimating confidence intervals for the unknown parameters, with a joint coverage probability of at least $1-\alpha$. Their goal is to produce confidence intervals that collectively produce a small difference between the upper and the lower bound to yield tighter joint uncertainty. In the same paper, they considered the set of familiar $\hat{\theta} \pm z_{\alpha/2}+SE_k$ individual confidence intervals, assuming an independently distributed $\hat{\theta}_1, \hat{\theta}_2, \dots, \hat{\theta}_K$. This approach, while simple, disregards the idea that $\theta_k$s may be correlated. 

In the case of ranking senatorial candidates in the Philippines, this assumption is limiting as it treats vote shares as statistically independent across candidates. Although senators are elected using Multiple Non-transferable Vote system (MNTV) - where candidates are voted for individually regardless of partisan membership and alliances (@pork), pre-election surveys and actual results (*add references*) suggest that candidates who belong to the same political alliance often perform similarly, although not always equally well. (*add more examples and references*) For example, in the 2025 election, several candidates from both the Marcos and Duterte blocs secured seats, while others from the same groups did not. Accounting for these correlations allows for a more realistic assessment of uncertainty in the estimated ranks for similar use cases.
