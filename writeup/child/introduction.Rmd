Ranked data are commonly of interest because they allow readers to compare populations based on ranked quantities. For example, top  universities across the globe may be identified based on their institutional performance indicator; states may receive appropriate intervention according to their relative rank based on average travel times to work; and senatorial candidates who are likely to win seats can be predicted by public opinion polls prior to elections. Whenever data on the entire population are unavailable, the ranks are based on estimates rather than the unknown parameters. Consequently, their overall uncertainty---expressed through joint confidence intervals---should also be quantified. Marginally, these intervals provide information on the possible range of each rank while jointly, they facilitate comparing all ranks simultaneously rather than reporting them in isolation. 

Several studies have addressed this concern through different techniques. Some approaches like those by  @klein, @jelle, @mogstadt23, @carling and @johan, relied solely on the estimates and their standard errors, constructing joint confidence intervals either for the estimated quantities or directly for the ranks themselves. Others fit models in which institutional differences are modeled explicitly via latent effects, thereby accounting for the dependence among student observations induced by the multilevel structure (Spiegelhalter, 1996). Miller (2009) developed a bootstrap algorithm that allows for the assumption of independence in the estimators despite its potential violation while @mogstadt25 proposed a bootstrap procedure that explicitly accounts for the dependence in estimators that are multinomially distributed.

Assuming independence when constructing joint confidence regions for estimators that are, in fact, correlated may lead to overly conservative and thus wider intervals, implying greater uncertainty—contrary to what is desired. The more general setting, which to our knowledge has not yet been explored, allows for a certain degree of correlation among the estimates to be ranked. This thesis develops a procedure capable of handling such dependencies while maintaining coverage close to the nominal level and producing relatively narrow joint confidence intervals. The proposed methodology uses only the observed estimators and their corresponding standard errors. Although it also employs a parametric bootstrap—commonly used to estimate overall rank uncertainties (e.g., @carling, @mogstadt23, @mogstadt25)—our implementation differs from these existing approaches --- @mogstadt23 and @mogstadt25 obtained bounds for the simultaneous confidence sets which depend on quantiles from the distribution of the maximum (over k) of the differences (See Section \ref{sec:pairwise}, instead of just the estimators while @carling implemented it to obtain a calculated measure as discussed in Section \ref{sec:calculated-measure}.

## Objective {#sec:objective}

This research builds upon @klein's methodology by extending the set of joint confidence intervals used to capture uncertainty in overall rankings. In particular, it intends to:

- Develop a procedure to construct joint confidence intervals for the ranks and the ranked parameters when the estimates to be ranked may be correlated.
- Evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches under various parameter settings.
- Compare the results of Algorithm 1 to Klein's joint confidence regions that uses Bonferroni and independence assumption, in terms of coverage and tightness measures.
- Apply the proposed approaches to a real-life example.

## Significance {#sec:significance}

In order to obtain joint confidence sets for overall ranks, @klein estimates confidence intervals for the unknown parameters, with a joint coverage probability of at least $1-\alpha$. Their goal is to produce confidence intervals that collectively produce a small difference between the upper and the lower bound to yield tighter joint uncertainty for ranks. In the same study, they used individual confidence intervals of the form $\hat{\theta}_k \pm z_{\alpha/2}\times \sigma_k$ for the population parameters $\theta_1, \theta_2,\ldots,\theta_K$, assuming that the estimates of these parameters $\hat{\theta}_1, \hat{\theta}_2, \dots, \hat{\theta}_K$ are independently distributed. This approach, while simple, is no longer applicable to the case where $\hat\theta_k$s may be correlated. In many cases, assuming independence in the presence of correlated quantities leads to conservative confidence intervals resulting in wider intervals which imply a higher uncertainty in overall ranks. 

In the Philippines, senators are elected using Multiple Non-transferable Vote system (MNTV)---where candidates are voted for individually regardless of partisan membership and alliances (Ravanilla & Hicken, 2023). This applies to pre-election polls where each voter $X_i$ selects at most 12 from a pool of $K$ candidates. We let the data $\mathcal{X}$ be a set of $n$ vectors of length $K$, $\mathcal{X} = \{X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n\}$, where $X_i = (X_{i1},X_{i2}, \dots, X_{iK})$ and $X_{ik} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_{k})$ where $p_{k}$ is the probability that voter $i$ selects candidate $k$ for $k \in \{1, 2, \dots, K\}$ and $i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$. $X_{ik} = 1$ if voter $i$ selects candidate $k$ and $0$ otherwise. Public opinion polling bodies report their results by ranking the proportion of votes $\hat{\theta}_k$ garnered by the $K$ candidates from the highest to the lowest, stating individual uncertainty to emphasize who can potentially make it to the top 12. Figure \@ref(fig:pulse) is an example of results from @pulseasia2025; this shows that 19 out of the 64 senatorial candidates have statistical chances of winning a seat as of a week prior to the previous 2025 elections. The shaded rows correspond to the ultimate winners. Pulse Asia Inc. notes their surveys are conducted with a 95%
confidence level, with confidence intervals calculated using 2.8% margin of error for a sample size of 1,200. To obtain the estimates, each response is weighted to compensate for the unequal selection probabilities in the sample design.

In weak-party systems, candidates who belong to the same political alliance or ticket commonly co-occur in ballots and hence perform with similarity (David & Legara, 2015). As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pulse), the competitive list is dominated by ten out of 11 (all except Tolentino) candidates under *Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilipinas*, which was actively campaigned by the incumbent president at the time. Four candidates (Go, Dela Rosa, Salvador, and Marcoleta) are associated with the Duterte-backed alliance *DuterTen*, while two (Pangilinan and Aquino) belong to the opposition-backed *KiBam*. The remaining candidates—Marcos, Revillame, and B. Tulfo---do not formally belong to any alliance but benefit from strong name recall. This alliance-based pattern is consistent with dependence in individual voting behavior. 

Because each voter is allowed to vote for up to 12 candidates, votes cast by the same individual are not independent. This dependence is reflected at the aggregate level through the proportions of total votes received by candidates, resulting in correlated proportion estimates. Accounting for these dependencies can lead to rank estimates with reduced overall uncertainty and, consequently, shorter simultaneous confidence intervals. In particular, the range of plausible ranks for each candidate may be narrowed, depending on the degree of correlation among candidates’ vote shares.

## Scope and Limitations

This study proposes methodologies to construct joint confidence regions to quantify uncertainty in overall ranks, building upon the main results of @klein. Unlike the study of @klein, however, this thesis addresses the case where the parameter estimates may be correlated. Moreover, this study also proposes a methodologies to construct joint confidence regions for the ordered parameters. It applies the parametric bootstrap in implementing the procedures, with a strong emphasis on maintaining the desired coverage. However, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the framework assumes that the data are generated from a multivariate normal distribution. Second, a limited set of correlation structures is examined to illustrate how different dependence assumptions may affect the resulting joint confidence sets. That it, we do not discuss how to estimate the correlation matrix from the data.
